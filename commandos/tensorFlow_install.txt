Install TensorFlow
The final step is to install Pip and the GPU version of TensorFlow:

sudo apt-get install -y python-pip python-dev
sudo pip install tensorflow-gpu
We can now start a Python console and create a TensorFlow session:

python
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> session = tf.Session()
If everything went well, it will recognize the Tesla K80 GPU:

I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:885]
Found device 0 with properties: 
name: Tesla K80
major: 3 minor: 7 memoryClockRate (GHz) 0.8235
pciBusID b0b5:00:00.0
Total memory: 11.17GiB
Free memory: 11.11GiB
Remember to deallocate the VM when done to avoid using cycles:

az vm deallocate -g tensorflow -n tensorflow
Once no longer needed, you can delete the virtual machine by running:

az vm delete -g tensorflow -n tensorflow
az group delete -n tensorflow
